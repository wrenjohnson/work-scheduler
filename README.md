This website is a scheduler for your work days.

I used the languages HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jquery, and bootstrap along with Git Bash and VSCode to complete this project.

This website contains the  date at the top of the application, 9 text boxes coresponding to the hours of 9 AM to 5 PM where you can add events to your schedule, colors to indicate the hour you are currently in and the hours remaining in the day, a save button to save your events and a clear buttons to reset your schedule.
